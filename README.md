# Image_Processing_using_Verilog
In this FPGA Verilog project, some simple processing operations are implemented in Verilog such as inversion, brightness control and threshold operations. The image processing operation is selected by a file and then, the processed image data are written to a bitmap image for verification purposes. The image reading Verilog code operates as a Verilog model of an image sensor/ camera, which can be really helpful for functional verifications in real-time FPGA image processing projects. The image writing part is also extremely useful for testing as well when you want to see the output image in BMP format.
